import random
board = list of 9 -'s for each space in the board
reference = the board with numbers instead of - (prettyified)
Define win function (parameters: turn, board):
    set out to "None"
    set wins to list with lists of each possible wins
    floop for all items in wins:
        if all the items in wins are equal turn
            set out to exit message
    set win function to out
display the board
loop forever (until broken):
    ------PLAYER TURN------
    inp = the user's choice for space
    loop while inp is not valid:
        inp = the user's choice for space
    set the board's space which the user chose to an X
    display the board
    ------CHECK BOARD------
      ---WIN?---
    run win function and set it to message
    if message does not equal "None":
        break out of loop
      ---TIE?---
    set spaces to 0
    for each item in the board
        if the place does not equal -:
            increment spaces by 1
    if the number of spaces is zero:
        set message to tie message
        break out of loop
    ------COMPUTER TURN------
    set inp to a random integer number 0-8
    loop while the random number is not valid:
        set inp to a new random integer number (0-8)
    set the board's space which the computer chose to an O
    display the board
    ------CHECK BOARD------
      ---WIN?---
    run win function = message
    if message does not equal "None":
        break out of loop
display final message (who won)
